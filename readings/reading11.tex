\maketitle

From Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}, read
\begin{itemize}
\item 4.4 Applications of the Hodge theorem
\end{itemize}
to wrap up any loose ends from last week\ldots But then, dive into
\begin{itemize}
\item 5.1 Vector bundles
\item 5.2 Geodesics and parallel translation of vectors
\end{itemize} where we meet \textbf{vector bundles}, at long last
providing precision to the vagueness of writing $TM$ for the
\textit{tangent bundle} of a smooth manifold $M$; this geometric
object gathers together all the separate $T_p M$'s, the tangent spaces
at each point $p \in M$, into a single object.  Armed with objects, we
can then talk about the morphisms---bundle maps---and even morphisms
which change the base space.  And knowing what the morphisms are, we
also learn about isomorphisms of bundles, and consequently it makes
sense to ask ``Are the tangent bundles to spheres ever trivial?''
meaning ``Is $TS^n$ ever isomorphic to the trivial $n$-dimensional
bundle over $S^n$?''

In other developments of the material, vector bundles appear very
early in the course, and there are some good reasons for this: when we
were first learning about atlases and charts, we considered
``transition functions'' moving us from one chart to another.  For a
vector bundle, we again see transition maps.

But there are also reasons to meet vector bundles \textit{after}
cohomology.  With transition maps, we'll see the ``cocycle
condition.''  And having seen de Rham cohomology with compact
supports, for vector bundles there is a new ``cohomology with compact
support in the vertical direction'' to study.
